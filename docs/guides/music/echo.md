[**Echo**](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo) is an extension-based music player app. It can play music from streaming websites (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, Deezer) and self-hosted servers (e.g., Jellyfin). Echo also supports external lyrics and music tracking (e.g., Last.fm).

## Getting started

### Installing Echo
- Download the first ZIP file from the [**nightly**](https://nightly.link/brahmkshatriya/echo/workflows/nightly/main/artifact) page.
- Unzip the downloaded file. If your file manager doesn't support unzipping, try using [MiXplorer](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=23109280).
- You will find an `.apk` file inside. Install it on your device.


### Installing extension
Extensions are mix of `.eapk` and `.apk`. `.eapk` ones will be installed without any extra steps. But for `.apk`, you have to install it like normal apps.

## Troubleshooting

### General

#### Extension Update Issue
Some ISPs might block GitHub raw or gist URLs, which can prevent extension updates. To work around this, use a [VPN](/qs#vpn).

___

### Deezer

#### Deezer not available in my country
Use a [VPN](/qs#vpn) to create your Deezer account. After that, you can access Deezer without a VPN by using a proxy server. To set up a proxy, go to :material-symbols-settings-outline-rounded: **Settings** -> :material-symbols-stream-rounded: **Extension** -> **Deezer** -> **Use Proxy**, and select a proxy server from the list.
